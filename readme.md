Prusa i3 Extruder
-----------------

This is a derivative of Kliment's excellent work on his 'i3ext' project for
the Prusa i3 3D printer.

I have modified it to work with jhead hotends (potentially dual extrusion, 
if stacked vertically), MK7-compatible hobbed pulleys, and variable mount 
hole spacings.

The extruder requires:

* NEMA17 stepper motor
* two 625zz bearings (r4zz's potentially used instead?)
* long M5 bolt, washers, nut
* MK7 hobbed pulley (Makerbot, TrinityLabs, etc)

I have not tested this yet, so consider it highly experimental.
